# New Materials

PlusTiC Reforged supports a wide range of materials from many mods. PlusTiC focuses on using tags instead of item IDs so that it may support a wide range of mods that all include the same items. Below is a list of all the materials that PlusTiC Reforged supports.

> [!NOTE]
> Any materials that use tags _should_ be supported in virtually every mod that includes the specified item. If a material is not supported, it is likely that the mod does not add the item to the specified tag, and you may want to file an issue on that mod's issue tracker.

> [!WARNING]
> Currently, gem blocks and other non-metal blocks are not supported. This is a known issue and will be fixed in a future update.

See the [Mod Support](./Mod%20Support.md) page for a list of mods that PlusTiC Reforged supports.
