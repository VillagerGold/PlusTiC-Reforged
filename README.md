# PlusTiC (Minus Bad) AKA xXx_MoreToolMats_xXx
Minecraft mod for adding new tools to and integrating various mods with Tinkers Construct

CurseForge page: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/plusticminusbad
## New tool(s)
- Katana. A fast two-handed weapon that deals increasing damage the more mobs you kill.
- Laser Gun. A ranged weapon that requires durability and energy (Forge, Tesla, RF).
## A note about Natural Pledge
Starting in 5.1.2.0, PlusTiC forces out and *overrides* Natural Pledge TiC materials by default. This can be changed in the config so that PlusTiC does *not* add Botania materials if Natural Pledge is loaded.
